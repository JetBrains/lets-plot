###
**Lets-Plot** is an open-source plotting library for statistical data. It is implemented using the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/).

The design of Lets-Plot library is heavily influenced by Leland Wilkinson work [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics) describing the deep features that underlie all statistical graphics.

> This grammar [...] is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes [it] very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.
> - Hadley Wickham, "ggplot2: [Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6829192-ggplot2)"

Due to the unique multi-platform nature of Kotlin programming language, you can obtain the plotting functionality that is packaged as a JavaScript library, JVM library, and a native Python extension.

The `Lets-Plot for Python` package offers a ggplot-like API for data visualization in [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) notebooks 
as well as in other notebooks like [Datalore](https://view.datalore.io/notebook/Zzg9EVS6i16ELQo3arzWsP), 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alshan/lets-plot-quickstart) or [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o9rFQbkGqvvixYLTogrzIjFPp1ti2cH-).
  
You can even craete plots using Python editor in PyCharm or IntelliJ IDEA (Scientific mode, the [Lets-Plot in SciView plugin](#pycharm_plugin) is required).   
  
Read [Lets-Plot for Python](README_PYTHON.md) documentation to learn more about the package installation and usage.

## JVM artifacts and Kotlin API

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/jetbrains/lets-plot-maven/lets-plot-jars/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/jetbrains/lets-plot-maven/lets-plot-jars/_latestVersion)

[Lets-Plot Kotlin API](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin) adds Grammar-of-Graphics plotting capabilities to Kotlin kernels for Jupyter notebooks.

Apart from Jupyter notebooks, **Lets-Plot Kotlin** API enables embedding plots into a JVM-based application.

To learn more about creating plots in a JVM environment see [README_DEV.md](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin/blob/master/README_DEV.md) 
in the [Lets-Plot Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin) project on GitHub.

[![JetBrains plugins](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/d/14379-lets-plot-in-sciview.svg)](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14379-lets-plot-in-sciview)

The plugin adds support for interactive plots in IntelliJ-based IDEs with the enabled _Scientific mode_.

The _Scientific mode_ in PyCharm and in IntelliJ IDEA Python plugin provides support for interactive scientific computing and data visualization.

To learn more about _Scientific mode_ check these help pages:
* [Scientific mode in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/matplotlib-support.html)
* [Scientific mode in IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/matplotlib-support.html)
