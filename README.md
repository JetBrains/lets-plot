###
**Lets-Plot** is an open-source plotting library for statistical data. It is implemented using the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/).

The design of Lets-Plot library is heavily influenced by Leland Wilkinson work [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics) describing the deep features that underlie all statistical graphics.

> This grammar [...] is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes [it] very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.
> - Hadley Wickham, "ggplot2: [Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6829192-ggplot2)"

Due to the unique multi-platform nature of Kotlin programming language, you can obtain the plotting functionality that is packaged as a JavaScript library, JVM library, and a native Python extension.

### Python Extension 

[Learn](README_PYTHON.md) how to create plots in Jupyter using the Lets-Plot python package.
