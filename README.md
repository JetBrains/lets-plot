##

**Lets-Plot** is an open-source plotting library for statistical data. 

The design of Lets-Plot library is heavily influenced by Leland Wilkinson work [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics) describing the deep features that underlie all statistical graphics.

> This grammar [...] is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes [it] very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.
> - Hadley Wickham, "[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html)"

We provide ggplot2-like plotting API for Python and Kotlin users. 


## Lets-Plot for Python

</a>

A bridge between R (ggplot2) and Python data visualization.

Learn more about *Lets-Plot for Python* installation and usage at the documentation website: https://lets-plot.org.          


## Lets-Plot for Kotlin

</a>

*Lets-Plot for Kotlin* adds plotting capabilities to scientific notebooks built on the Jupyter [Kotlin Kermel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter).

You can use this API to embed charts into Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS applications as well.

*Scientific mode* in PyCharm and in IntelliJ IDEA provides support for interactive scientific computing and data visualization.

[*Lets-Plot in SciView*](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14379-lets-plot-in-sciview) plugin adds 
support for interactive plotting to IntelliJ-based IDEs with the *Scientific mode* enabled.

## What is new in 2.2.0

- Added support for `coord_flip()`. 

  See: [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JetBrains/lets-plot/blob/master/docs/f-21-10/notebooks/coord_flip.ipynb).
                          

- Improved plot appearance and better `theme` support:

  - Bigger fonts across the board;
  - Gridlines;
  - 4 themes from ggplot2 (R) library: `theme_grey(), theme_light(), theme_classic(), theme_minimal()`;
  - Our designer theme: `theme_minimal2()` (used by default);
  - `theme_none()` for the case you want to design another theme;
  - A lot more parameters in the `theme()` function, also helpers: `element_line()`, `element_rect()`, `element_text()`.

  See: [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JetBrains/lets-plot/blob/master/docs/f-21-10/notebooks/themes.ipynb).
    
> Note: fonts size, family and face still can not be configured.


- Improved Date-time formatting support:

  - tooltip format() should understand date-time format pattern [[#387](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/issues/387)];
  - scale_x_datetime should apply date-time formatting to the breaks [[#392](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/issues/392)].

  See: [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JetBrains/lets-plot/blob/master/docs/f-21-10/notebooks/datetime_formatting.ipynb).


- `corr_plot()` function now also accepts pre-computed correlation coefficients. I.e. the following two expressions are equivalent:
```python
    corr_plot(iris_df).points().labels().build()
    corr_plot(iris_df.corr()).points().labels().build()  # new
```
