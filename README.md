###
**Lets-Plot** is an open-source plotting library for statistical data. It is implemented using the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/).

The design of Lets-Plot library is heavily influenced by Leland Wilkinson work [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics) describing the deep features that underlie all statistical graphics.

> This grammar [...] is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes [it] very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.
> - Hadley Wickham, "ggplot2: [Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6829192-ggplot2)"

Due to the unique multi-platform nature of Kotlin programming language, you can obtain the plotting functionality that is packaged as a JavaScript library, JVM library, and a native Python extension.

## Python Extension

## JVM artifacts and Kotlin API

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/jetbrains/lets-plot-maven/lets-plot-jars/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/jetbrains/lets-plot-maven/lets-plot-jars/_latestVersion)

[Lets-Plot Kotlin API](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin) adds Grammar-of-Graphics plotting capabilities to Kotlin kernels for Jupyter notebooks.

Besides Jupyter notebooks, **Lets-Plot Kotlin** API enables embedding plots into a JVM-based application.

To learn more about creating plots in a JVM environment see [README_DEV.md](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin/blob/master/README_DEV.md) in
[Lets-Plot Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin) project on GitHub.
