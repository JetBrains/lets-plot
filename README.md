##

**Lets-Plot** is an open-source plotting library for statistical data. 

The design of Lets-Plot library is heavily influenced by Leland Wilkinson work [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics) describing the deep features that underlie all statistical graphics.

> This grammar [...] is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes [it] very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.
> - Hadley Wickham, "[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html)"

We provide ggplot2-like plotting API for Python and Kotlin users. 


## Lets-Plot for Python

</a>

A bridge between R (ggplot2) and Python data visualization.

Learn more about *Lets-Plot for Python* installation and usage at the documentation website: https://lets-plot.org.

</a>

*Lets-Plot for Kotlin* adds plotting capabilities to scientific notebooks built on the Jupyter [Kotlin Kermel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter).

You can use this API to embed charts into Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS applications as well.

*Scientific mode* in PyCharm and in IntelliJ IDEA provides support for interactive scientific computing and data visualization.

[*Lets-Plot in SciView*](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14379-lets-plot-in-sciview) plugin adds 
support for interactive plotting to IntelliJ-based IDEs with the *Scientific mode* enabled.
 
>
> **Note:** The *Scientific mode* is NOT available in communinty editions of JetBrains IDEs.

## What is new in 2.1.0
                      
- Upgraded dependencies:

  - Kotlin: 1.5.21
  - Apache Batik: 1.14 [[#398](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/issues/398)]

- Ordering categories:
 
  New parameters added to the `as_discrete` function:

  - `order_by` (string) - the name of the variable by which the ordering will be performed;
  - `order` (int) - the ordering direction: 1 for ascending direction and -1 for descending (default).

  See: [as_discrete](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/blob/master/docs/as_discrete.md).

- Interactive maps:

  - Pre-configured raster tilesets in new `lets_plot.tilesets` module.
  - Builtin blank maptiles.

  See: [Configuring basemap tiles](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/blob/master/docs/basemap_tiles.md).
