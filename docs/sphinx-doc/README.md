### Sphinx-doc directory

This directory contains sources for building project documentation using Sphinx-doc.


#### Requirements:

1. Install Sphinx-doc: 
    `conda install sphinx` or `pip install -U Sphinx`.   
    Other ways: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html
    
2. Install `jupyter_sphinx` extension: `conda install jupyter_sphinx` or `pip install jupyter-sphinx`.

3. All dependencies, used in your executable code inside the documents must be installed to your Python/Anaconda environment.


#### How to use:

1. Create docs in `reStructuredText` format (files `*.rst`):   
    https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html
    
2. Put them in the `source` directory. Any additional directory can be created inside for the structure optimisation.

3. Add paths to new docs in the `index.rst` file.

4. Build documentation (HTML): change dir to `docs/sphinx-doc` and execute the command:   
    `sphinx-build -b html source/ build/`

5. Open `docs/sphinx-doc/build/index.html` in your browser and check result.


#### File structure:
     
 - `source/` - main source folder
 - `source/conf.py` - main config file
 - `source/index.rst` - source file for index.html (main page with content tree and etc.)
 - `source/ref` - directory with current reference document sources.
 - `source/usage` - directory with current usage document sources. 
 - `source/_static` and `source/_templates` - service directories (auto-generated). Can be used in the future.
 - `build/` - directory containing generated documentation as prepared structure. Will be added by executing `sphinx-build` command. **Ignored by Git.**
 - `jupyter-execute/` - directory generated by the `jupyter_sphinx` extension. Contains files `*.py` and `*.ipynb` (executed code from the documents sources). **Ignored by Git.**
 - `make.bat` and `Makefile` - build files for `make`. Generated by the `sphinx-quickstart` command.
