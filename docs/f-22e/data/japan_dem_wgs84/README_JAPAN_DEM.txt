Notes:

For the Regional Systems Analysis of Japan, the GTOP0 30 arc second resolution data tiles were projected into Lambert Comformal Conic project using Clarke 1866 datum, with units in meters.

The details for this are: 
Units: meters
Central meridian: 135 E
Standard parallel #1: 39 N
Standard parallel #2: 27 N
Latitude of origin: 33 N
Datum: Clarke 1866
Cell size:  846 m


Subsequently the DEM tiles were trimmed to the islands of Japan (including Hokkaido and the Senkyaku Chain) and reprojected into a Geographic Coordinate System decimal degrees WGS-84 version.

The cell size in decimal degrees of the distributed WGS-84 version is 0.010215556.
