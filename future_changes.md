## [4.5.3] - 2024-mm-dd

### Added

### Changed

- Axis breaks: changed default `lower_exp_bound` to -7 and `upper_exp_bound` to 6 (same as in `theme(...)`).

### Fixed
- Tooltip should not cover and hide the geometry that it provides info for [[#1275](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/issues/1275)].
- General purpose scale_continuous: can't use the 'expand' parameter [[#1285](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/issues/1285)].
