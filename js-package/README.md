## CDN

Lets-Plot project uses `JsDelivr` as CDN service for JS artifacts:

https://www.jsdelivr.com

For CDN update release JS artifacts should be pushed to the project repository with `git tag` (check [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/blob/master/RELEASE.md#3-build-and-copy-javascript-artifacts-to-the-publish-directory)).

CDN link to release artifact looks like:

`https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/lets-plot.min.js`

For example: https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/releases/download/v3.2.0/lets-plot.min.js
