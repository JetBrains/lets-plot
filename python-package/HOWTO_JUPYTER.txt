- Jupyter must be installed in Python environment (IPython.display is required)

- set PYTHON_INCLUDE environment variable with path to python include path

- build project (gradle)

In terminal:
    - create/activate Python environment (I use conda)
    - cd to datalore-plot/python-package
    - copy all JS to package data: python setup.py updatejs
    - install python package: python setup.py install


Start local web-server to serve our js scripts (from /datalore-plot/visualization-demo-plot/build/demoWeb/lib):
    - cd to datalore-plot/visualization-demo-plot/build/demoWeb/lib
    - python -m http.server 8080
Note: this step is not necessary is our JS is injected into notebook from the package resources (the default currently)


View a plot:
    - in Jupyter notebook try code:

from datalore.plot import *
data = dict(time=['Lunch', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Dinner', 'Dinner'])
p = ggplot(data) + geom_bar(aes(x='time', fill='..count..'))
p += scale_fill_hue()
p

Bar plot should show up.
