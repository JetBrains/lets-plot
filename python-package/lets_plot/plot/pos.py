def position_dodge(width=None):
    """
    Adjust position by dodging overlaps to the side.

    Parameters
    ----------
    width : float
        Dodging width, when different to the width of the individual elements.
        This is useful when you want to align narrow geoms with wider geoms.
        The value of width is relative and typically ranges between 0 and 1.
        Values that are greater than 1 lead to overlapping of the objects.

    Returns
    -------
    `FeatureSpec`
        Geom object position specification.

    Notes
    -----

def position_dodgev(height=None):
    """
    Adjust position by dodging overlaps to the side.

    Parameters
    ----------
    height : float
        Dodging height, when different to the height of the individual elements.
        This is useful when you want to align narrow geoms with taller geoms.
        The value of height is relative and typically ranges between 0 and 1.
        Values that are greater than 1 lead to overlapping of the objects.

    """
    Adjust position by assigning random noise to points. Better for discrete values.

    Parameters
    ----------
