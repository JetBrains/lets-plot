### Color Maps

The color maps `viridis`, `magma`, `inferno`, and `plasma` were created by
Stéfan van der Walt ([@stefanv](https://github.com/stefanv)) and Nathaniel
Smith ([@njsmith](https://github.com/njsmith)).

The color map `cividis` is a corrected version of `viridis`, developed by
Jamie R. Nuñez, Christopher R. Anderton, and Ryan S. Renslow.

The color map `turbo` was developed by Anton Mikhailov to address the
shortcomings of the Jet rainbow color map such as false detail, banding and
color blindness ambiguity.

The color map `twilight` was created by Bastian
Bechtold ([@bastibe](https://github.com/bastibe)) : [twilight](https://github.com/bastibe/twilight).
